# A simplistic approach to build ansible master node and client. 


1. Step 01: 

    	# build the Ansible Server image 
	    docker build -f DockerfileAnsible -t ansible-docker . 
	    # build the Ansible managed Nodes
	    docker build -f DockerfileAnsibleNode -t ansible-node . 
	    # now start the nodes
	    docker compose up -d 
	    # add keys from nodes to master
	    docker exec -it ansible_control /bin/bash
		ssh-keyscan -H ansible_node1 >> $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts 
		# running inside docker
		ssh-keyscan -H ansible_node2 >> $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts 
		#running inside docker
        ssh-keyscan -H ansible_node3 >> $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts # running inside docker
2. Step 02:
   
   You will need to create a user ansible if not already created and set its password in the first time on each node
   e.g. usage: 

       docker exec -it ansible_node1 /bin/bash 
	   sudo bash 
	   passwd ansible
	   exit
	   exit 
    [Repeat for ansible_node2, ansible_node3.....] 

3. Step 03:
   
   Next Connect from Ansible-master to each off the node 

   e.g usage

       # docker exec -it controlnode /bin/bash 
	   ssh ansible@ansible_node1
	   #[ you will be asked to enter password ] 
	 	ssh-copy-id ansible@ansible_node1
		#[ you will be asked to enter password ] 
		ssh ansible@ansible_node1
		#[no password will be required now] 
	
		[Repeat for ansible_node2, ansibleb_node3... ] 

The usage is you do a docker exec to the master node and ssh-copy-id its public key to nodes for user ansible. 
Then corresponding ssh's will not require password and the master node can be used to run playbooks on the nodes. 

4. Step 04:
   
   * Add inventory file
   * login to control node
	    
         docker exec -it controlnode /bin/bash
         # create folder and files
		 # As normal user
		 sudo bash 
		 # as root
		 mkdir -p /etc/ansible/
		 touch /etc/ansible/hosts
		 echo ansible_node1 >> /etc/ansible/hosts
		 echo ansible_node2 >> /etc/ansible/hosts
		 echo ansible_node3 >> /etc/ansible/hosts		
		 chown -R ansible /etc/ansible
		 exit
		 exit
